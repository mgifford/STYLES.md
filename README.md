# STYLES.md

A machine-readable style standard for human and AI collaboration.

Your style guide should be a file, not a PDF. Put it at your repo root where
every developer, reviewer, and AI coding agent can find it.

## What is STYLES.md?

STYLES.md is an open format for writing down how your project communicates —
voice, tone, design tokens, and AI agent constraints — in a single Markdown file
that both humans and machines can read, follow, and automate against.

It is part of a three-pillar ecosystem:

| Standard | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| [ACCESSIBILITY.md](https://github.com/mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md) | Foundational inclusion requirements and contributor guardrails |
| [SUSTAINABILITY.md](https://github.com/mgifford/sustainability.md) | Environmental and compute-efficiency constraints |
| [STYLES.md](https://github.com/mgifford/STYLE.md) | Voice, design tokens, and AI agent style rules |

## Why does this exist?

In an era of AI-assisted development, a style guide that lives as a PDF or a
Figma board is invisible to the tools doing the work. STYLES.md makes your
standards explicit, version-controlled, and testable.

- **Humans** get a clear, plain-language reference at the repo root.
- **AI agents** get a machine-readable constraint file they can follow without guessing.
- **Reviewers** get a checklist they can verify in CI.

## How to replicate this

1. **Fork** this repository or copy [STYLES-template.md](./STYLES-template.md) into your project root.
2. **Choose an example** from the [examples](./examples/) folder close to your context.
3. **Customize** — replace every `[PLACEHOLDER]` with your project's real values.
4. **Connect the pillars** — add [ACCESSIBILITY.md](https://github.com/mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md) and [SUSTAINABILITY.md](https://github.com/mgifford/sustainability.md) for a full governance baseline.
5. **Wire it up** — reference `STYLES.md` in your `AGENTS.md` and LLM system prompts.
